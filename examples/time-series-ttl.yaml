# 
# This example runs the BasicTimeSeries workload with a TTL of five minutes.
# The workload will run for a duration of 5 hours and 30 minutes. tlp-stress 
# will connect to the cluster via a headless service named stress. Since 
# tlp-stress is configured with RF = 3, the Cassandra cluster should have at 
# least three nodes.
